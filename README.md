# Seam-Carving
Seam Carving Project using Dynamic Programming on an Array in C along with Rasterization of Image Inputs into Computable Data

Executable File is seamcarving.c -- all other files are included. The code uses Dynamic programming on an array to minimize a cost and removes a column of pixels (slims down) an image without removing any of its key features

seamcarving.c includes test cases in main, which can be commented out or replaced with your own test cases. Make sure that the line of code which exports for every iteration is commented out!

seamcarving.h includes all of the structs and functions necessary to run

cimg.c contains all of the rasterization functions to process the image
